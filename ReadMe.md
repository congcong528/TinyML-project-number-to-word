Demonstrate how the sequence-to-sequence model deployed on Arduino.This 
project I have created a simple model which translated digit to words. 
This model aims to map a fixed-length input with a fixed-length output where 
the length of the input and output may differ. 

For example, input “1” which has a length 1 and output “one” which has a length 3. In 
this project I am using long short-term memory (LSTM) to train my data.
